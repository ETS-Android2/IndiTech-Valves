# IndiTech-Valves
In this era where everything is digitized by technology, our proposed system aims at developing an android
application for digitizing quality check documents of raw materials used for making of the valves. Now, as we know valves
are found in every industrial process. It is a device that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid. It can be customized
as per the needs of the industry and the needs of the customers. These products and especially the products that are
customized need assurance of the quality and the procedure that the product undergoes to meet the exact requirements.
Manually it is really difficult to do the quality check of all the materials that are getting used for the making of the valves.
So, we’ve proposed a solution where this application can be used to easily track the quality of the raw materials and its
authorized documents such as certificates and warranty/guarantee papers.
Based on some criteria and pattern unique barcodes will be generated for each raw material. By using these
uniquely generated barcodes, QR codes will be generated for the valves which can be shared as well as can be printed. Raw
material’s information can be tracked on a uniquely identified scheme (Barcode) whereas valves can be tracked using QR
codes. After scanning the QR code, all the details and documents associated with that particular valve will be displayed on
the user’s screen.
